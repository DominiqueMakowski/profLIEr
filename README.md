# profLIEr
A Companion App for the LIE Profile Questionnaire

# About

This is a research tool to complement the Deception Scale Validation Study (Makowski et al., in preparation), a study aimed at investigating 
the structure of dispositional deception. We validated the LIE Profile questionnaire on a diverse sample and found that
dispositional deception consists of 4 latent dimensions:
- **Ability**: the reported proficiency and ease to create and deliver believable lies)
- **Frequency**: the reported tendency to lie
- **Negativity**: the negative perception of lying related to internal factors, such as emotions or moral values
- **Contextuality**: the flexibility of one's willingness to lie related to external factors such as stakes, necessity or alternative options

Findings also reveal the existence of distinct lying profiles, i.e., clusters of specific patterns of the dimensional structure (Names of the profiles to be refined).
Hence, the app classifies individuals into different profiles based on their responses to the LIE items along the visual analogue scales.
